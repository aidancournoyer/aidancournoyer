I am a student at UT Austin, studying Behavioral and Social Data Science as well as Government. I am additionally obtaining a teachers certification, and I hope to go into education policy. 

I work for the Science of Learning and Metacognition lab, The City of Austin, The College of Natural Sciences, and other entities in the Austin area.
